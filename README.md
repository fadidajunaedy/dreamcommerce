# DreamCommerce

A simple e-commerce application built to showcase basic features of an online store. This project is part of my journey to learn and implement **React.js** and **Redux** for state management.

## Features

- **Search by Title**: Quickly find products by typing the product name in the search bar.
- **Category Filter**: Filter products based on categories for a better user experience.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product, including price, description, and images.
- **Add to Cart**: Easily add products to your cart.
- **Cart Management**:
  - Increase or decrease the quantity of products in the cart.
  - Empty the cart with a single action.
- **Wishlist**: Mark products as favorites and manage your wishlist.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: Redux (with Redux Toolkit)
